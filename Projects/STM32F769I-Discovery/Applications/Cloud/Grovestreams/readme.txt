@par Application Description


This application implements a Grovestreams Cloud HTTP client for the STM32F769I-Discovery board
using the on-board Ethernet interface driven by the LwIP TCP/IP stack,
and mbedTLS for secure network communication.

The application connects to Grovestreams IoT Cloud with the credentials provided
by the user. When the User button is pushed, it sends a LED toggle command to
the IoT Cloud endpoint, which returns back the message to the board and
triggers the LED toggle. 

Upon a double-push of the User button, the application exits.

@par Hardware and Software environment
  - STM32F769I-Discovery board.
  - Ethernet router.
      * With a transparent Internet connectivity: No proxy, no firewall blocking the outgoing traffic.
      * Running a DHCP server delivering the IP and DNS configuration to the board.


  - A Grovestreams account is required, along with a Component and Streams.
    For the Led state a boolean stream named "Led" must be added to the component created in Grovestreams.

    Detailed instructions:

    - Grovestreams account creation:
    Connect to http://grovestreams.com.
    Create an account (email and password).
    Log-in to grovestreams.com.
    Create an organization and enter it.
    - Component creation
    In Observation Studio, create a Component. (right-click on Components and select New).
    Give it a name (example: "iotboard"). Enter a Component ID (example: 1234).
    The application will use this component ID to publish stream values to the cloud.
    - Led stream:
    Right-click on the component, select "Edit component".
    Right-click on "Streams", select "Add / Stream / Stream (Most commonly used)"
    Enter Name: "Led", ID: "Led", Data Type: boolean type, do not change the Unit.
    The application will use the Stream ID "Led" to publish Led state values in Led stream.
    - API key:
    In the top menu, select Admin / API keys.
    In the API keys box, click on "+" to create a new key.
    Give it a name like "Put/get key", and an ID ("PUT_GET_KEY").
    In the same "Add API Key" dialog box, in Resources section, click on "Add Type"
    then select "Component/*/feed".
    Click again on "Add Type" then select type "Component/*/stream".
    For both types, check boxes only for PUT and GET actions.
    Click on Save to exit the "Add API key" box.
    Check the box for the API key just created, and click on "View secret key" button.
    Take note of the API secret key that is displayed (copy/paste to a temporary file)
    and close the box.
    The application will use this API key to publish stream values to the cloud.

    - device configuration:
    Flash the board with the compiled application. Connect to the board's USB COM port with serial terminal.
    Press the board's User button when asked if you want to update the device security parameters or credentials.
    Enter the API key noted previously.
    Enter the component ID as noted previously (do not confuse with the component's name).
    Enter the TLS security certificate (Projects\Common\Grovestreams\godaddy_comodo.pem)


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

 - WARNING: Before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
   
 - WARNING: read and write operations frequency
   Too frequent read and write operations to the cloud server may lead to some latencies or disconnections.
   The limits need to be checked and conform with the cloud provider documentation.
   See https://grovestreams.com/developers/limits.html

 - Open the IAR IDE and compile the project (see the release note for detailed 
   information about the version). Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision 
   toolchain (see the release note for detailed information about the version). 
   Alternatively you can use the System Workbench for STM32 (see the release note 
   for detailed information about the version). 

 - Program the firmware on the STM32 board: If you generated a raw binary file, 
   you can copy (or drag and drop) it from Projects\STM32F769I-Discovery\Applications\Cloud\Grovestreams\EWARM\STM32F769I-Discovery\Exe
   to the USB mass storage location created when you plug the STM32 
   board to your PC. If the host is a Linux PC, the STM32 device can be found in 
   the /media folder with the name e.g. "DIS_L4IOT". For example, if the created mass 
   storage location is "/media/DIS_L4IOT", then the command to program the board 
   with a binary file named "my_firmware.bin" is simply: cp my_firmware.bin 
   /media/DIS_L4IOT. 

   Alternatively, you can program the STM32 board directly through one of the 
   supported development toolchains, or thanks to the STM32 ST-Link Utility.
  
 - Configure the required settings (to be done only once): 
   - When the board is connected to a PC with USB (ST-LINK USB port), 
     open a serial terminal emulator, find the board's COM port and configure it with:
      - 8N1, 115200 bauds, no HW flow control
      - set the line endings to LF or CR-LF (Transmit) and LF (receive).

   - At first boot, enter the required parameters:

     - Enter the Grovestreams api key created on Grovestreams web site.

     - Enter the component ID needed for Grovestreams Cloud.

     - Enter the root CA certificate for grovestreams.com and for RTC time setting.
       
   - After the parameters are configured, it is possible to change them by restarting the board 
     and pushing User button (blue button) when prompted during the initialization.

@par Connectivity test

  - By default the Grovestreams project tries to automatically connect to Grovestreams cloud
    (using the parameters set above). 

  - Push the User button (blue button) to toggle the LED value and send it to the cloud.
    After a few seconds, the application reads back the LED value from the cloud
    and changes the LED state accordingly.
